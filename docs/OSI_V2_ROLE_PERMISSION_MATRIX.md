# OSI V2 — Role & Permission Matrix

**Status:** Blueprint / design-only. Every privileged row names a **server-side enforcement point**. A hidden or disabled button is never authorization (P10). Proof column uses the hybrid model (D15): **Memo** = Solana memo outcome; **Sig** = signMessage + server-verified receipt; **Sys** = system event.

## Roles
`anon` · `wallet` (connected ordinary) · `case_owner` (proven) · `report_author` (proven) · `wire_author` (proven) · `contributor` · `candidate` · `probationary` · `analyst` (verified+approved) · `senior` · `adm_wallet_only` (admin wallet, no auth) · `adm_auth_only` (auth, wrong wallet) · `maintainer` (double-gate) · `service` (Edge Function).

**Server enforcement legend:** `EF` = Edge Function verifies (signature and/or Supabase JWT + `analyst_profiles`/maintainer); `RLS` = row policy; client checks are UX-only.

## 2. Report + versions

| Operation | wallet | author | analyst | maintainer | Enforcement | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Select winning version | – | ❌ | quorum | ✅ **maintainer required** | EF ≥2 indep **+ Σweight ≥2.50 + maintainer**; server sets winner from quorum tally | Memo `REPORT_SELECTED_WINNING` |

## 3. Wire

| Operation | wallet | wire_author | analyst | maintainer | Enforcement | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Submit wire report / version (v1 & every revision) | ✅ | (author) | ✅ | ✅ | EF sig | Memo `WIRE_REPORT_VERSION_SUBMITTED` |

| Promote to case | – | – | ✅ | ✅ | EF analyst/maintainer | Memo `WIRE_PROMOTED` |
| Support author | ✅ | – | ✅ | ✅ | EF support endpoint | Memo `SUPPORT_SENT` (no ranking effect) |

## 4. Challenge (admissibility gate)

| Operation | wallet | analyst | maintainer | Enforcement | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Submit challenge | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | EF sig + reason + **`evidence_item_id` FK** (URL first becomes an `evidence_items` row) + **exactly-one typed target FK** + rate-limit + one-active + cooldown; sets `admissibility_ttl_at` | Sig `CHALLENGE_SUBMITTED` |
| Accept admissibility (→ pauses sealing) | – | ✅ | ✅ | EF analyst/maintainer, **`admitted_by_wallet≠challenger`**; sets `review_deadline_at` | Sig `CHALLENGE_ADMISSIBILITY_ACCEPTED` |
| Reject admissibility (inadmissible) | – | ✅ | ✅ | EF analyst/maintainer, **≠challenger**; **no penalty**; no pause | Sig `CHALLENGE_ADMISSIBILITY_REJECTED` |
| Merit review (per analyst) | – | ✅ | ✅ | EF **eligible independent analyst, ≠challenger** (and ≠ target author/owner/creator); `challenge_reviews{phase:merit}` | Sig `CHALLENGE_REVIEW_CAST`/`_REVISED` |
| Accept/reject (outcome) | – | quorum | (analyst only) | EF ≥2 indep **+ Σweight ≥2.50** (**no maintainer gate**); target-specific consequence (State Machines §5.1) | Memo `CHALLENGE_ACCEPTED`/`CHALLENGE_REJECTED` |
| Bad-faith review (per analyst) | – | ✅ | ✅ | EF **eligible independent analyst, ≠challenger**; only on a rejected/withdrawn/expired challenge; `challenge_reviews{phase:bad_faith}` | Sig `CHALLENGE_BAD_FAITH_REVIEW_CAST`/`_REVISED` |
| Bad-faith outcome | – | quorum | (analyst only) | EF ≥2 indep **+ Σweight ≥2.50**; sets `bad_faith_state` (server-derived) | Memo `CHALLENGE_BAD_FAITH_CONFIRMED`/`CHALLENGE_BAD_FAITH_DISMISSED` |
| Withdraw own (any non-terminal state) | challenger | – | – | EF sig; **not after a final accepted/rejected outcome** | Sig `CHALLENGE_WITHDRAWN` |
| Expire (timeout) | – | – | – | system on `admissibility_ttl_at`/`review_deadline_at`; releases pause | Sys `CHALLENGE_EXPIRED` |

Submission alone never pauses sealing; only `open`/`under_review` do. No non-terminal state is stuck — each has a TTL/escalation path. **The challenger is excluded from admissibility, merit review, and bad-faith review of their own challenge.** Honest rejection/withdrawal/expiry carries **no automatic penalty**; a penalty follows only a **confirmed** bad-faith quorum.

## 5. Analyst application & lifecycle

| Operation | self | analyst | senior | maintainer | Enforcement | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Submit application version (Path A, v1) | ✅ | – | – | – | EF sig; RLS insert `analyst_applications` + immutable `analyst_application_versions` | Sig `ANALYST_APPLICATION_VERSION_SUBMITTED` |
| Resubmit/revise application (new version) | ✅ | – | – | – | EF; new `analyst_application_versions` (`supersedes_version_id`) | Sig `ANALYST_APPLICATION_VERSION_SUBMITTED` |
| Review application version | – | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | EF eligible reviewer; **`reviewer_wallet≠applicant_wallet` (applicant cannot review own application)**; targets exact `analyst_application_versions.id` | Sig `ANALYST_APPLICATION_REVIEW_CAST`/`_REVISED` |
| Path B derivation | (auto) | – | – | – | server-derived from resolved case | Sys `ANALYST_CANDIDATE` |
| Promote candidate→probationary | – | – | ✅ (future ≥3 senior, flag) | ✅ | EF; **server-derived eligibility**, no discretionary tier | Memo `ANALYST_PROBATION` |
| Verify | – | – | – | ✅ | EF maintainer double-gate | Memo `ANALYST_VERIFIED` |
| Revoke | – | – | – | ✅ | EF maintainer | Memo `ANALYST_REVOKED` |
| **Self-verify** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | impossible by design | – |

## 6. AI Pack

| Operation | owner | analyst | maintainer | Enforcement | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Generate draft | ✅ (own case) | ✅ | ✅ | EF `osi-ai-pack generate`, server evidence; case/version approved | Sys `PACK_SUBMITTED` |
| Owner feedback (advisory) | ✅ | – | – | EF; writes `ai_pack_owner_feedback` (**not** `ai_pack_reviews`), **uncounted**, owner-only | Sig `AI_PACK_OWNER_FEEDBACK_SUBMITTED` |
| View `content_owner_safe` | ✅ own | ✅ | ✅ | EF authorization | – |
| View `content_analyst_restricted` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | EF | – |
| View public brief | public | public | public | RLS (approved) | – |
| Attest support/dispute/request_revision | ❌ own | ✅ (≠creator) | ✅ | EF `ai_pack_reviews`, reviewer≠creator | Sig `AI_PACK_REVIEW_CAST`/`_REVISED` |
| Approve version (outcome) | ❌ | quorum (≠creator) | ✅ **maintainer required** | EF ≥2 indep **+ Σweight ≥2.50 + maintainer**, creator excluded | Memo `AI_PACK_APPROVED` |
| Reject version (outcome) | ❌ | quorum (≠creator) | (analyst only) | EF ≥2 indep **+ Σweight ≥2.50** (**no maintainer gate**), creator excluded | Memo `AI_PACK_REJECTED` (class A) |

## 7. Reward & Support

| Operation | owner | wallet | analyst | maintainer | Enforcement | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pledge reward | ✅ | – | – | – | EF sig; intent, no custody | Memo `REWARD_PLEDGED` |
| Send reward to winner | ✅ | – | – | – | client tx + EF records on RPC confirm | Memo `REWARD_PAID` |
| Voluntary support author/analyst | – | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | EF support endpoint, confirmed tx; **no ranking/discovery effect** | Memo `SUPPORT_SENT` |

## 8. Public analyst attribution (correction #14 / D16)
For any **public** governance decision (public Cases, published Reports/Wire Reports, approved AI Packs, resolutions, completed challenges), the public view shows for each participating analyst or full initial-open maintainer: **role, public profile/handle where applicable, wallet, decision, weight snapshot used (maintainer initial-open = 0), timestamp, proof type** (`solana_memo` / `wallet_signed_server_verified` / `system_event`), and a public-safe receipt/tx reference. Restricted always: private notes, private evidence, moderation reason detail, sensitive reason text. Pre-open/private queue shows **counts only**.

## 9. The two half-maintainer roles

| Operation | `adm_wallet_only` | `adm_auth_only` | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Any maintainer mutation | ❌ | ❌ | `resolveMaintainerAccess` needs **wallet AND auth**; RLS restricts writes to the maintainer auth UUID |
| Ops Center | locked | locked | double-gate |

## 10. Service role
`service` (Edge Function service-role key) is the only writer for publication, review tallies, resolution finalization, pack storage, reputation snapshots, and **all `event_receipts` inserts** (server-only Proof Log write — closes the current anon-writable gap). Never in client code. RLS denies anon/user writes to these.

## 11. Enforcement summary
Signature-verified identity for all owner/analyst actions (ed25519, purpose+target+payload-hash bound, **server-issued single-use nonce persisted/consumed in `osi_nonces`**, freshness). Analyst authorization = server `analyst_profiles` lookup. Maintainer = double-gate + auth-UUID RLS. Quorum/weight computed server-side. Pending privacy = RLS default-deny + owner-proof Edge path. No support-based ranking anywhere.

**Counted-review eligibility (correction #6 — applies to every counted Report / Wire / resolution / challenge / AI-Pack / application review):**
- Only **eligible verified analysts** cast counted reviews; **ordinary connected wallets never write any `*_reviews` table** (they may only *submit* Cases/Reports/Wire Reports/challenges and voluntary support).
- **Maintainer status alone confers no analyst voting weight.** A maintainer's vote is counted **only if the same wallet is separately analyst-eligible**, and then only after all exclusions pass. The single exception is the independent full-maintainer Case initial-open path: its review stores weight `0`, requires both maintainer gates, and authorizes only public investigation. It does not count as an analyst vote or imply truth/guilt. The maintainer *finalization* act (for resolution/winner, AI-Pack approval, seal) remains distinct from casting a weighted analyst vote.
- **Server-enforced exclusions on every counted review:** author (Report/Wire), owner (Case/resolution), creator (AI Pack), applicant (analyst application), and challenger (challenge admissibility/merit/bad-faith) are excluded from deciding their own item — enforced in the Edge Function, never by a hidden button.
- **Both gates shown:** every analyst-quorum outcome that requires them lists `≥N_min independent` **and** `Σweight ≥ W_thr`; the three maintainer-gated outcomes (resolution/winner, AI-Pack approval, seal) additionally require a maintainer signature. Case initial open alone also permits full maintainer approval as an alternative to, not an added gate on, its analyst path (D5).
